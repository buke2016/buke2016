# Designing a road using NetworkX, Peartree, PyViz, GeoJSON, Google Transit, Google Maps, and Waymo involves multiple steps and the integration of various libraries. I'll provide a high-level overview of the process, but keep in mind that the actual implementation can be complex and may require detailed knowledge of each library.
# pip install networkx peartree pyviz geojson googletransit googlemaps waymo
# Create a Road Network with NetworkX and Peartree:
# Use NetworkX to create a graph representing the road network. Peartree is a library built on top of NetworkX for working with public transportation data. You can use it to generate a road network from OpenStreetMap or another data source.

import networkx as nx
import peartree as pt

# Create a graph (replace with your data or OSM data)
G = nx.Graph()

# Use Peartree to add nodes and edges to the graph
pt.graph_to_nx(pt.OsmNetwork.from_file("your_osm_data.xml"), G)

# Visualize the Road Network with PyViz:
# PyViz provides a convenient way to visualize large graphs. Use the hvplot function from PyViz to visualize your road network.

import holoviews as hv
import hvplot.networkx as hvnx

# Convert the NetworkX graph to a HoloViews object and plot it
hv_graph = hvnx.graph(G)
hv_graph.opts(title="Road Network Visualization")

# Load and Display GeoJSON Data:
# If you have GeoJSON data for additional information (e.g., landmarks, traffic conditions), load it and overlay it on the road network.

import geopandas as gpd
import folium

# Load GeoJSON data
geojson_data = gpd.read_file("your_geojson_data.geojson")

# Create a folium map
m = folium.Map(location=[latitude, longitude], zoom_start=12)

# Add GeoJSON data to the map
folium.GeoJson(geojson_data).add_to(m)

# Display the map
m

# Integrate Google Transit and Google Maps:
# You can use the Google Transit API to get public transportation data and the Google Maps API for additional mapping functionality.
from googletransit import get_routes
import googlemaps

# Use Google Transit API to get public transportation routes
routes = get_routes(source, destination)

# Use Google Maps API for additional mapping functionality
gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key='your_api_key')
directions = gmaps.directions(origin, destination)

# Explore Waymo Data:
# If you have access to Waymo data, you can explore it using the Waymo Python client library.
from waymo_open_dataset import dataset_pb2 as open_dataset

# Load Waymo dataset
dataset = open_dataset.Dataset()
dataset.ParseFromString(data)  # Replace 'data' with your Waymo data


#Remember to replace placeholder values like "your_osm_data.xml," "your_geojson_data.geojson," and API keys with your actual data and credentials. Additionally, make sure to check the documentation of each library for more detailed information on how to use them in your specific use case.
