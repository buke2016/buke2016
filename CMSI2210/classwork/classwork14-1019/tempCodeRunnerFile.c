/*
 *  file: duplicitous.c
 *  practice with File I/O by doing the following:
 *
 *    read the command line arguments
 *    if none are present, output a usage message of how to run the
 *       program next time
 *    also if none are present, ask the user for a file name
 *    also if none are present, ask the user for an integer between 1 and 10
 *       this will be used for the number of times to copy file contents
 *    regardless of input method, set the filename into a variable called
 *       'filename'
 *    also regardless of input method, set the integer into a variable
 *       called "copies"
 *    try to open the input file and report any errors that occur
 *    if the file opens OK, read the first line from the file
 *    convert the number on the line from a string to an int; this is the
 *       count of lines to be copied to the output file ~ call this 'count'
 *    display a message: file %s is open will copy %d lines
 *    now create an output file name, using the name output.txt
 *    open the output file and report any errors that occur
 *    read each line of the input file, writing it to the output file
 *    when count lines have been written to the output, write a newline
 *       to the output file
 *    call the rewind() function to move the input file pointer back to the
 *       start of the input file JUST AFTER the first line
 *    read each line of the input file again, writing it to the output file
 *    repeat steps 14, 15, and 16 for copies times
 *    close both files
