/*
 *  file:  mouseandcheese.c
 *  plays a simple version of a word-guessing game
 *  Rules
 *     The goal of the game is to prevent the mouse from reaching the cheese
 *     You are given a word that you must guess, one letter at a time
 *     You have ten guesses total, meaning the mouse has ten steps to reach the cheese
 *     For each letter you guess right, the mouse stays put
 *     For each letter you guess wrong, the mouse moves one step closer to the cheese
 *     For each correct guess, the letter is displayed in the word
 *     If the mouse reaches the cheese before you guess the word, you lose the game
 *     If you guess the word before the mouse reaches the cheese, you win the game
 *     For multiple occurrences of a letter in a word, one correct guess will display
 *       all of them; for example, if there are three E's in the word, one guess of 'E'
 *       will display all three
 *  Game Mechanics
 *     The main game must be in a file called mouseandcheese.c
 *     The word is selected randomly from an array of words which are strings
 *     Initially all the letters are indicated by underscores, dashes, or some other
 *       non-letter you pick
 *     You must keep track of which letters have been used
 *     You must keep track of the number of incorrect guesses
 *     You must display the number of steps remaining before the mouse reaches the cheese
 *       after each guess
 *     You must display the current state of the word after each guess; for example, if
 *       the word is NANDGATE and the letters N and A have been correctly guessed, and the
 *       letters S, T, and I, have been incorrectly guessed, after five guesses you should
 *       display:
 *
 *     N A N _ _ A _ _    with seven steps left
 *
 *     This is a virtual abstraction game; you are NOT required to make a drawing of a
 *       mouse, the cheese, the steps, or any other part of the game except the letters
 *       and steps as shown above
